      <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely
        shocked when I got to know that I’ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution.
        It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very
        first time so I didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time I felt a little sad but I decided
        that I’d do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision to
        participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, I was not
        concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because
        of that I have gotten this prize, My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my
        achievement and now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.</p>
